In this repository, I will be working on implementing the 40 Scott and Burgen fuel categories into WRF-SFIRE. 
The main file we are concerned about is the namelist.fire. I will have my final copy of the namelist.fire in the home directory at all times. 
14_namelist_fire is a simulation setup using the original 14 Albini categories
40_Scott_Burgen is another simulation setup but this time it's using the 40 different fuel types
Codes is where all of my matlab codes will be stored. These are used to test not only the 40 fuels, but to test the original fuels as well to see if our rothermel model is like other models rothermel models. We are currently comparing to BEHAVEplus and BEHAVE and may include WFA later on.
Data is where I have a bunch of spreadsheets containing the 40 fuel categories.
Papers is where all of the necessary papers for this implementation are stores.
